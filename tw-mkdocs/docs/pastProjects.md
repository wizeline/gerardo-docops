# My Projects
I am 25 years old, I haven't had that much professional experience, but I do have projects on my portfolio that I am proud of.

## As a Student

### International College Program at Walt Disney World
I had the opportunity to work for four months at Walt Disney World. I was in the Food & Beverage department, and my responsabilities went from greeting Guests to manage orders during rush hour.

### Taller Vertical - Misión: MArTE
My team and I developed a videogame for elementary school students, using gamification concepts for them to learn Math while playing. 

## As a Project Manager

### Karisma Travel Agents Portal
This is probably my biggest professional achievement until this day. I managed a 30 people team to develop a [portal](https://karismatravelagents.com/en_US/home) for Karisma Hotels & Resorts. During this project, I was in charge of my development team, my clients, and the design and analysis of the project in general.

### Sistema de Depósitos Vehiculares de Jalisco
I was in charge of the business analysis, design, and management for this project. We created a new administration panel for the government. The project impacted the 8 vehicular deposits that exist in Jalisco.

## As a Technical Writer

### LifeMiles Foundations
I had the opportunity to work with Franchesco (a.k.a. Chesco) to do a Foundations process for the IT department of LifeMiles, to identify the problems they had and how to correct them properly.

### Cobalt Enhancement Project
This is my actual project, I am in charge of creating documentations proposals for our client, and until now, I think I am doing a good job out of it.
