Some may say I'm a Jack of all trades, but master of none, and I do embrace that. My Hobbies Some of the things I enjoy doing are: * I like going to the movies. My friends and I miss the cinema a lot, so we created a VideoClub where we see a movie and disscuss it once a week. Our club is about to turn 1 year old. We have uploaded some of the sessions on my YouTube Channel . I also have a Letterboxd Movie List with recommendations, if you want to watch a cool-interesting movie. * I love creating Spotify Playlists. I have tons of them on my profile , even if I inevitably end up listening to Taylor Swift at the end. * I love taking pictures of pretty things. Most of them I have never posted them anywhere. Photography is one of my favorite creative outlets. * One thing that was interesting about me was that I have a blog where I wrote during High School and College, but that's not something too special between Tech Writers. * I know how to play the guitar. * I am a Disney fanboy, so if you ever want to travel to the Disney Parks, let me know so I can give you one or two tips! I can also solve all your Marvel / Star Wars / Pixar doubts and theories. * I like playing videogames and board games, specially when I can do it with my friends. I play League of Legends, Overwatch and Civilization 6. My favorite board games are Pandemic, Catan and Machi Koro. * A group of friends and I have a podcast house called Fenic\u00f3ptero with 4 unreleased podcasts. We did release one called Los Metagonistas, you can find it on Spotify .","title":"Hobbies and Fun Facts"},{"location":"hobbies/#about-me-and-my-free-time","text":"My friends always tease me with the fact that I know a little about a lot of things.

As a Student International College Program at Walt Disney World I had the opportunity to work for four months at Walt Disney World. I was in the Food & Beverage department, and my responsabilities went from greeting Guests to manage orders during rush hour. Taller Vertical - Misi\u00f3n: MArTE My team and I developed a videogame for elementary school students, using gamification concepts for them to learn Math while playing. As a Project Manager Karisma Travel Agents Portal This is probably my biggest professional achievement until this day. I managed a 30 people team to develop a portal for Karisma Hotels & Resorts. During this project, I was in charge of my development team, my clients, and the design and analysis of the project in general. Sistema de Dep\u00f3sitos Vehiculares de Jalisco I was in charge of the business analysis, design, and management for this project. We created a new administration panel for the government. The project impacted the 8 vehicular deposits that exist in Jalisco. As a Technical Writer LifeMiles Foundations I had the opportunity to work with Franchesco (a.k.a. Chesco) to do a Foundations process for the IT department of LifeMiles, to identify the problems they had and how to correct them properly. Cobalt Enhancement Project This is my actual project, I am in charge of creating documentations proposals for our client, and until now, I think I am doing a good job out of it.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"pastProjects/#my-projects","text":"I am 25 years old, I haven't had that much professional experience, but I do have projects on my portfolio that I am proud of.","title":"My Projects"},{"location":"pastProjects/#as-a-student","text":"","title":"As a Student"},{"location":"pastProjects/#international-college-program-at-walt-disney-world","text":"I had the opportunity to work for four months at Walt Disney World.
