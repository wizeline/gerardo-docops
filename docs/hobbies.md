## About Me and My Free Time
My friends always tease me with the fact that I know a little about a lot of things. Some may say I'm a Jack of all trades, but master of none, and I do embrace that.

### My Hobbies
Some of the things I enjoy doing are:
* I like going to the movies. My friends and I miss the cinema a lot, so we created a VideoClub where we see a movie and disscuss it once a week. Our club is about to turn 1 year old. We have uploaded some of the sessions on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/geravelasco). I also have a [Letterboxd Movie List](https://letterboxd.com/geravm/list/top-movies-you-should-watch/) with recommendations, if you want to watch a cool-interesting movie.
* I love creating Spotify Playlists. I have tons of them on my [profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/1280122233?si=OyA5uPX1TRq21FbQLYya3Q), even if I inevitably end up listening to Taylor Swift at the end.
* I love taking pictures of pretty things. Most of them I have never posted them anywhere. Photography is one of my favorite creative outlets.
* One thing that was interesting about me was that I have a [blog](https://www.geravelasco.com) where I wrote during High School and College, but that's not something too special between Tech Writers.
* I know how to play the guitar.
* I am a Disney fanboy, so if you ever want to travel to the Disney Parks, let me know so I can give you one or two tips! I can also solve all your Marvel / Star Wars / Pixar doubts and theories.
* I like playing videogames and board games, specially when I can do it with my friends. I play League of Legends, Overwatch and Civilization 6. My favorite board games are Pandemic, Catan and Machi Koro.
* A group of friends and I have a podcast house called Fenic√≥ptero with 4 unreleased podcasts. We did release one called Los Metagonistas, you can find it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2YQRbb1JR0Nkt7u8LLBWJl?si=7XKv2xI1RWCVCc5FPru00w).
